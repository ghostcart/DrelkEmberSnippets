Snippets of code to be used with Ember

##ALTTARGET

A system to store a second target and swap between it and the primary one at will..
Useful in areas with multiple mob types..
You will need to rename the target alias shown in the picture in the dropbox to choosetarget.
To use: You can use target as you have been, but now you can also.


target alt _______ to set the alternate target.


target alt to view the current alternate target, like you would with target.


target swap to swap your primary target for your alternate one.

##ATTACKCOMMANDS
Speaking of cribbing off of Marty, I liked his ATTACK command so much that I made copies for all the convenient attack verbs,
That is to say, if you don't specify a target, they'll attack the target specified by Ember.


BASH THRUST SLASH and SHOOT

##REPEATCOMMAND

I am hesitant to share this one, but I decided to go ahead.
However, this is only intended for use while the player is at the keyboard.
Using it to automate activities while AFK is not intended, and will likely to lead to a ban.
You've been warned!

Anyway, this is a group of scripts that will allow you to make the client repeat a specified command at a specified interval.


REPEAT is the most basic, repeating the command.


REPTARGET will work with Ember's targeting system to use the command on the target.


REPCOMBO is intended for unarmed combat, but is currently broken and disabled. If you feel like poking at it, let me know if 
you find the issue.


REPSTOP will cancel out of any repeats active as long as it's the last command entered when they go to repeat. A bit hackish, but it works.


REPCHANGE Jack of all trades for altering the current active repeat.


PAUSE Toggles to a paused state, allowing looting and other activities.

All syntax is given by appending help to any of the commands.

I'll pretty up with pictures if people have trouble.
