If you feel like poking at it, let me know if you find the issue.\r\nREPSTOP will cancel out of any repeats active as long as it's the last command entered when they go to repeat. A bit hackish, but it works.\r\nREPCHANGE Jack of all trades for altering the current active repeat.\r\nPAUSE Toggles to a paused state, allowing looting and other activities.\r\nAll syntax is given by appending help to any of the commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n##TO INSTALL\r\nDownload the file.\r\nOpen the session you wish to use it in.\r\nOpen Settings.\r\nSelect File-> Import from XML.\r\nNavigate to the file and select it.\r\nWait a few seconds.\r\nViola!\r\n\r\nI'll pretty up with pictures if people have trouble.\r\n\r\n",
